Hello there! 👋

I'm a Fullstack developer. I write JavaScript, TypeScript and have been grinding on Next.js a bunch recently. Prisma has been my ORM of choice.  

I love tabletop boardgames, listening to music, and a foodie at ❤.

I'm a coding bootcamp graduate and I love talking to new programmers. Feel free to reach out!
