Hello there! 👋

I'm a Fullstack developer. 

I write JavaScript, TypeScript and have been grinding on Next.js and Prisma lately.

I love technology, tabletop boardgames, and a foodie at ❤.

I'm a coding bootcamp graduate and I love talking about programming. 

How can I help? Feel free to reach out!
